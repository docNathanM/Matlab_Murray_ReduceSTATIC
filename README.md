# Matlab_Murray_ReduceSTATIC
 Matlab functions to load ASCII text files generated by the STATIC data acquisition LabView VI's.

`nm_loadStaticData()` will read the header line and create a struct with the variable names set as the column names. The output includes the entire data array as well as mean and variance arrays. The mean and variance arrays may not be useful if averaging is needed over some specific segments of the data (like the steady portion).

## Uncertainty Quantification

`example_uncertaintyCalcOnTunnelConditions.m`

I spent quite a bit of time sorting out the random uncertainty calculation over the years. This example uses the Matlab function `prctile(x,p)` because it automatically ignores `NaN` values in the input string.

The user input is a desired confidence interval, c, such that one could report a mean value, mu, and mu +/- c. For a 95% confidence interval on a normal distribution this c is 1.96 times the standard deviation (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConfidenceInterval.html). A 95% confidence interval is ...
$$
95\%\,C.I. = \mu \pm 1.96\sigma.
$$
The approach with `practice(x,p)` is a bit different because the function is already estimating the CDF from the input array and producing the upper/lower bounds of the confidence interval directly rather than assuming a normal distribution.
